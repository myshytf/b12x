"""CE-driven PCIe ring allreduce for prefill-size tensors.

NCCL's SM-copy transport sustains ~34 GB/s bus bandwidth on this fabric
while CE peer copies run at ~56 GB/s on every ring hop concurrently
(including the two root-complex crossings, which each own a partition
uplink per direction). This runtime drives a classic reduce-scatter +
all-gather ring where the data plane is CE copies and the SM only
synchronizes (monotonic flag kernels) and reduces, so captured graphs
replay without host patching.

        """Lossless ring all-reduce with a selectable chunk-to-element mapping
        and fp32 running sums on the trailing reduce-scatter hops.

        The step table comes from ``ring_schedule`` and every buffer range
        from ``lossless_access_plan``, which the CPU proofs execute and check
        as well, so what the tests reason about is what this loop issues; with
        ``B12X_PCIE_RING_CHECK_BOUNDS=1`` the plan is additionally checked
        against the slab capacities before a single kernel is issued. The kernel
        sequence per (step, piece) is the one ``_all_reduce_aligned`` issues
        on its lossless path: one CE copy on the copy stream, one flag on the
        flag stream, one wait plus one add (reduce-scatter) or placement copy
        (all-gather) on the main stream, and one neighbour handshake at the
        end. Two things can differ from the served schedule:

        * Mapping. ``granule_elems == 0``: the served contiguous mapping,
          chunk ``c`` is elements ``[c * shard, (c + 1) * shard)`` cut into
          ``_pick_pieces`` pieces. ``granule_elems > 0``: a piece is one
          granule and granule ``b`` of the flat buffer belongs to chunk
          ``b % world``, which fixes the number of pieces at
          ``shard_elems / granule_elems``.
        * Precision. With ``fp32_hops = p > 0`` the payloads of the last
          ``p`` reduce-scatter steps are fp32 running sums (twice the bytes,
          twice the receive area) and the adds that produce them keep fp32,
          so an element is rounded to bf16 ``world - 1 - p`` times instead of
