"""Arithmetic contract of the lossless PCIe DMA ring all-reduce.

``PCIeDmaAllReduce`` reduces a flat buffer as ``world`` chunks. Chunk ``c``
travels the rank ring starting at rank ``c``: rank ``c`` sends its own values,
rank ``c + 1`` adds its values to them, rank ``c + 2`` adds its values to that
sum, and so on, so every element of chunk ``c`` is summed in the rank order
``c, c + 1, ..., c - 1`` with one add per reduce-scatter hop. Each add reads
both operands as fp32 and stores the sum, which rounds it to bf16
(``cvt.rn.bf16x2.f32``). The all-gather phase copies finished chunks, so all
ranks end with the same bits.

Two properties of that schedule are configurable and are defined here so the
CUDA implementation and its CPU proofs cannot drift apart:

* **Chunk mapping** — which elements form chunk ``c`` (``piece_offset_elems``,
  ``granule_elems_for``, ``chunk_of_flat_elements``). The served mapping cuts
  the flat buffer into ``world`` contiguous shards, which makes an element's
  summation order depend on the tensor's row count. The granule mapping
  assigns fixed-size granules round-robin, which makes it depend only on the
  element's position inside a ``world * granule`` row period.
* **Hop precision** — how many trailing reduce-scatter hops carry the running
  sum as fp32 instead of bf16 (``ring_schedule``, ``chain_sum``,
  ``rounding_count``).

``ring_schedule`` is the step table the ring executes; ``execute_schedule``
runs that same table over CPU tensors, and ``ring_all_reduce_reference``
computes the intended result directly from the chain definition. Agreement of
the two is what makes the schedule table a proof rather than a restatement.

CPU only, torch only; no CUDA dependency.
