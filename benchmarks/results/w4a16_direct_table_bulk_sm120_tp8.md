# W4A16 direct-table bulk-copy qualification on SM120 TP8

Status: **qualified** for Kimi-K3 QSRT K2 layer-10 execution on one SM120
GPU at TP8; **not deployed**. The qualification covers exact output identity,
CUDA graph replay, and hot-cache latency for four and eight routed tokens.

## Implementations

The vector-copy arm stages each CTA's 64 KiB direct rate table with distributed
global loads, shared stores, and a CTA barrier. Its measured source revision is
`dda3ebdf3d56364d2fee5b4597a93f92cf84e0bb`, with source digest
`ba47552b9404836c03a4f392ba6fcbb1030efa427a0c0649a062729a7ce1d300`.

The bulk-copy arm stages the same bytes with one
`cp.async.bulk.shared::cta.global.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes` transaction and
waits on the CTA-scope barrier before FC1 or FC2 reads the table. Its measured
source revision is `c8b7d67625bbbc009cf14de076eb978f6b0cd646`, with source
digest `d012d17ac6a4af4b123fb6186ab2e8b6714fb12bb9662c136d160cc410921dbc`.
The compile result owns the selected device LUT slice, so capture-time launches
do not allocate or populate the process-lifetime direct-table cache.

Both Git worktrees were clean when the benchmark collected provenance. The

- Geometry: TP8 rank 0, 896 experts, top-k 16, hidden width 3,584, local
  intermediate width 384, SiTU activation, BF16 input, FP16 prepared weights,
  and `(128, 128, 128, 128)` W4A16 tiles.
- Timed region: complete fused route packing, FC1, activation, FC2, and output
  reduction through CUDA graph replay. Checkpoint loading, weight preparation,
  compilation, graph capture, and 50 warmup replays are excluded.
- Samples: 400 hot-cache replays per implementation and routed-token count.
  Lower time is faster; ratios below are bulk-copy time divided by vector-copy
  time.

- GPU: NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition,
  `GPU-9361804b-020b-3f67-9026-fca5d0264d5f`, SM120. Both arms recorded P1,
  3,082 MHz SM clock, 16,365 MHz memory clock, default compute mode, and no
  active clock-throttle reason before and after measurement.
- Environment: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` and
  `B12X_SQG_XOR_CHEB_T12_DIRECT_SMEM=1`. Each source revision used a distinct
  b12x compile-cache directory.

Each JSON artifact records its exact executable command. The shared arguments

## Results

| Routed tokens | Vector median | Bulk median | Bulk/vector | Reduction | Output SHA-256 equal |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---:|
| 4 | 116.384 µs | 114.336 µs | 0.9824 | 1.76% | yes |
| 8 | 171.680 µs | 167.584 µs | 0.9761 | 2.39% | yes |

For four routed tokens, the vector-copy p10/p90 interval was
115.360/117.280 µs and the bulk-copy interval was 114.240/115.456 µs. For
eight routed tokens, the corresponding intervals were 171.648/175.616 µs and
167.552/169.856 µs.

The exact output byte digests match between implementations:

- Four routed tokens:
  `9bb1e8c897b4c932282c78a1978abee317390ba62c07273a0e0951e788cb6a9d`.
- Eight routed tokens:
  `fdc7688894587397e5dca98a3121ee55f7e054c7c4bab7c271a5e7f998aa53aa`.

Every measured output was finite and nonzero, and each eager output was
bit-identical to its CUDA graph replay output.

## Conclusion and limitations

The bulk-copy prologue preserves the real checkpoint output exactly and lowers
the complete fused graph-replay median at both measured routed-token counts.
This evidence qualifies the implementation for the stated SM120 TP8 layer
contract.

The benchmark uses one workstation-class GPU that also hosts a resident draft
model process. It does not measure an eight-GPU serving step, request-level
throughput, cold-L2 behavior, or Max-Q GPU clocks. Those cases are unsupported
by this result and require separate qualification before deployment.
